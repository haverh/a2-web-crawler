That dog right there is a pretty good pet. I would say that she is oe-of-a-kind. She always greets the truck-driver with a smile. The problem is she is afraid of two things: spiders and chickens. She has two favorite things to do in summer â€” eat ice-cream and dive in the pool. She likes eating Bob's Burgers. Especially the special fries that Bob personally makes for her.
